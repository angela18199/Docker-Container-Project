# Docker Container Project
* Create a customized Docker container from the current version of Python that deploys a simple python script.
* Push image to DockerHub
* Pull the image down and run it on a cloud platform cloud shell: Google Cloud Shell or AWS Cloud9.

The python script would receive an input string using argument --name and print out "Hello {input}"
